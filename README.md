# AWS Config: Your AWS Environment's X-Ray Vision

AWS Config is your all-in-one solution for gaining complete visibility and control over your AWS infrastructure. It provides a detailed inventory of your resources, tracks configuration changes, and helps you ensure compliance and security.

## Key Benefits

* **Complete Visibility:**  Discover and inventory all your AWS resources, regardless of their type or location.
* **Configuration History:** Maintain a detailed audit trail of every change made to your resources, including who made the change and when.
* **Change Notifications:** Receive real-time alerts when your resource configurations change, enabling you to respond quickly to potential security or compliance risks.
* **Resource Relationships:**  (Coming Soon!) Visualize how your resources connect and interact, helping you understand dependencies and troubleshoot issues. 
* **Compliance Evaluation:** (Coming Soon!) Continuously assess your resource configurations against best practices or regulatory standards.

## Core Features

1. **Configuration Recorder:**
   - Automatically captures and records the configuration details of your AWS resources at regular intervals.
   - Provides a snapshot of your resources' current state, allowing you to track changes over time.

2. **Delivery Channel:**
   - Delivers configuration snapshots and change notifications to an Amazon S3 bucket for storage and analysis.
   - Optionally, sends notifications to an Amazon SNS topic to alert you of configuration changes in real time.

3. **Config Rules (Optional):**
   - Define the desired configuration settings for your AWS resources.
   - Use AWS Managed Rules for common use cases or create custom rules with Lambda functions for specific requirements.
   - Config Rules constantly monitor your resources and evaluate their compliance with the defined criteria.

## Why AWS Config is Essential

* **Security & Compliance:** Detect unauthorized changes and ensure your environment adheres to industry standards and regulations.
* **Operational Excellence:**  Gain insights into your infrastructure's configuration history, simplifying troubleshooting and root cause analysis.
* **Cost Optimization:** Identify unused or underutilized resources, leading to potential cost savings.
* **Change Management:** Understand the impact of changes before they are implemented, reducing the risk of unexpected disruptions. 


## The Missing Piece: Enter Conformance Packs

While AWS Config gives you incredible visibility into your AWS environment, it doesn't automatically enforce compliance with your desired standards. That's where Conformance Packs come in.

### Why AWS Config Alone Wasn't Enough

* **Manual Rule Management:** Creating and managing individual Config Rules for every compliance requirement was time-consuming and prone to errors.
* **Inconsistent Enforcement:** Ensuring consistent rule enforcement across multiple AWS accounts and regions required manual effort.
* **Lack of Pre-Built Standards:** You had to develop and maintain your own custom rules to align with industry standards like PCI DSS or HIPAA.
* **No Automated Remediation:** Non-compliant resources triggered notifications, but fixing them required manual intervention.
* **Scaling Challenges:** As your AWS environment grew, managing individual Config Rules became increasingly complex.

### How Conformance Packs Elevate Your Compliance

* **Pre-Defined Rule Sets:** Conformance Packs bundle multiple Config Rules into a single package, making it easy to deploy and enforce entire compliance standards with a few clicks.
* **Automated Compliance Checks:** Conformance Packs continuously evaluate your resources against the defined rules, ensuring ongoing adherence to your chosen standards.
* **Consistent Enforcement:** Easily deploy Conformance Packs across multiple AWS accounts and regions, ensuring consistent compliance throughout your organization.
* **Immutable Rules:** Once deployed, Conformance Packs are immutable, preventing unauthorized changes to your compliance standards.
* **Automated Remediation:**  You can configure Conformance Packs to automatically remediate non-compliant resources, saving you time and effort.

### In Summary

Conformance Packs fill the gaps in AWS Config by providing:

* **Simplified Compliance Management:**  Streamlined rule deployment and enforcement.
* **Pre-Built Compliance Standards:**  Ready-to-use rule sets for common industry standards.
* **Consistent Governance:**  Centralized control over compliance across your AWS organization.
* **Automated Remediation:**  Proactive measures to fix non-compliant configurations.
* **Scalability:**  Effortless scaling to accommodate the growth of your AWS environment.

**Other Advantages** 
* A collection of AWS Config rules organized into a single ARN addressable entity
* Creates immutable rules that cannot be changed once applied, even by admins
* Allows for process checks rules and simplifies reporting
* Organizes rules to meet compliance requirements and/or frameworks
* Can be used by AWS Organizations administrators to deploy AWS Config rules across an organization that cannot be modified by member account admins
* Use cases: Operational best practices and customized compliance
